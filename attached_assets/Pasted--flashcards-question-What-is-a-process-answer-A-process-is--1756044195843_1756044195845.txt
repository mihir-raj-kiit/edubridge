    {
      "question": "What are the three states of a process?",
      "answer": "The three states of a process are: running, waiting, and sleeping."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a process transition?",
      "answer": "A process transition is a change in the state of a process, for example, from running to waiting or from waiting to running."

    {
      "question": "What is a process creator?",
      "answer": "A process creator is the process that creates and launches a new process."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a process hierarchy?",
      "answer": "A process hierarchy is a tree-like structure showing the parent-child relationships between processes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is process synchronization?",
      "answer": "Process synchronization is a mechanism used to coordinate the activity of multiple processes, ensuring that they do not interfere with each other's access to shared resources."
